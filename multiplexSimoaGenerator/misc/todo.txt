Change code to use a csv file as input
Need to get the column position based on their real position on csv file
Change the sort logic to sort based on COLUMN first, then CAL, QC and others per beadPlex (Map<String, Map<Integer, List<ExcelRow>>>) - DONE
Change the populate logic:
	iterate over each key of the beadPlex map - DONE
	create the page using the name of the beadPlex (key of beadPlex map) - DONE
	iterate over the value map for the beadPlex key (=> the column) - DONE
	For each entry for the current column, try to find a match on sample name on the next column - DONE
	Do the same thing for column +2 - DONE
	
	
Move the Collection.Sort in BeadPlexBean - DONE

When generated we see some same samples separated from the others. Maybe we need to sort by sample and then location?
==> sampleA E03 F04
==> sampleB F03 F04
==> sampleE A05 A06      THAT ONE IS MISSING FOR NOW					DONE
